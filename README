This is scRamble

A pipeline written in R to scramble chromosomes across a set of individuals to avoid concerns about privacy of genetic data.
This should be done prior to submittion to non-European imputation panels due to privacy laws in the European union.

To run scRamble, move into the scRamble directory, then type:
Rscript bin/scRamble_sexchr.R [input.vcf.gz] [output_directory_name] [consider sex chromosome (yes/no)] [reference genome (hg19/hg38)]

For example, assuming that (i) the input file is called /path/to/chrAll.input.vcf.gz, (ii) you want the output files to 
be placed in folder path/to/scrambled_genotypes, you are interested in sex chromosomes and your genome version is hg38 then type:
Rscript bin/scRamble_sexchr.R path/to/chrAll.input.vcf.gz path/to/scrambled_genotypes yes hg38

After the run, you will find in the desired folder three output files:
1. the scrambled file in VCF format [chrAll_input_scrambled.vcf.gz]
2. mapping file to be used for unscrambling [Mapping_file.txt]

As it is virtually impossible to reconstruct the entire individual genotype without the key, these file can be shared and used for imputation.

After imputation is performed, you want to unscramble the outputs and reconstruct the original genotypes.

To do so, move into the scRamble directory and type:
Rscript bin/unscRamble.R [mapping_file.txt] [chr1_imputed.vcf.gz] [output_directory]

For example, assuming that (i) mapping file is called Mapping_file.txt, (ii) the imputed file, usually already divided in chromosomes, 
is called chr1_imputed.vcf.gz (make sure to specificy chromosome 1 here) and (iii) the output directory is out_unscrambled, then type:
Rscript bin/unscRamble.R path/to/Mapping_file.txt path/to/chr1_imputed.vcf.gz path/to/output_directory

After the run, you will find all chromosomes in individual files (PLINK2 format) in the desired folder.
